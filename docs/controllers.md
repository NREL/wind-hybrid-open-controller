# Controllers

The `whoc.controllers` module contains a library of wind and hybrid power plant
controllers. Each controller must inherit from `ControllerBase` (see 
controller_base.py) and implement a
mandatory `compute_controls()` method, which contains the relevant control 
algorithm and writes final control signals to the `controls_dict` attribute 
as key-value pairs. `compute_controls()` is, in turn, called in the `step()`
method of `ControllerBase`.

## Available controllers

### LookupBasedWakeSteeringController
Yaw controller that implements wake steering based on a lookup table. 
Requires a df_opt object produced by a FLORIS yaw optimization routine. See example 
lookup-based_wake_steering_florisstandin for example usage.

Currently, yaw angles are set based purely on the (local turbine) wind direction. The lookup table
is sampled at a hardcoded wind speed of 8 m/s. This will be updated in future when an interface is
developed for a simulator that provides wind turbine wind speeds also.

### WakeSteeringROSCOStandin
May be combined into a universal simple wake steeringcontroller.
