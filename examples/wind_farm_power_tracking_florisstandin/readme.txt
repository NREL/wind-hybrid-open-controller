This example runs a wind farm level power tracking controller, using FLORIS as a simulation
testbed rather than AMR-Wind. The control algorithm is based on the A2e2g project. 
To run the example, run bash_script.sh. This will run both an open loop and closed loop power 
tracking controller, and generate a comparison of their outputs as a plot.
